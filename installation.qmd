# Installation {.unnumbered}

## Basic Installation

Polars can be installed using pip:


```bash
pip install polars
```
## Optional Dependencies

Polars offers various optional dependencies for specific use cases, which are omitted to reduce the footprint of the library. Throught this guide I will mention when specific dependancts are required/used.

To install all optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install 'polars[all]'
```
::: {.callout-note}
I recommend installing all optional dependencies due to convenience. And the fact that the relative footprint is still not excessive.

### Interoperability  

Polars offers the following dependencys for increased interoperability between different librarys.

- __pandas__: allows conversion to and from pandas dataframes/series 
- __numpy__: allows conversion between numpy arrays
- __pyarrow__:allows for data conversion between PyArrow tables and arrays
- __pydantic__: allows for conversion from Pydantic models to polars

```bash
pip install 'polars[pandas, numpy, pyarrow, pydantic]' # remove the unused dependencies
```

### Excel

Polars has a few options for different engines used to convert xlsx files to a format more readable by polars.

The different engines avalible are:

- __calamine__
- __openpyxl__
- __xlsx2csv__

:::{.callout-tip}
 There are some differences in the engines performance and behaviour to learn more see the [official documentation](https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/io/excel/).

Additionally Polars support one other optional dependency related to Excel:
- __xlsxwriter__: which allows you to write to xlsx files

```bash
pip install 'polars[excel]' # if you want to install all Excel dependencies
pip install 'polars[calamine, openpyxl, xlsx2csv, xlsxwriter]' # if you want to pick and chose 
```
