# Introduction

## What is Polars 

Polars is a modern data manipulation library avalible for Python, R, NodeJs and Rust. It is  designed as a high-performance alternative to pandas, especially for large datasets. It features syntax that's both human-readable and similar to R's data manipulation paradigms. Polars stands out for three main reasons:

- **Performance**: Built in Rust, Polars delivers exceptional speed through parallel processing by default and a sophisticated query optimizer that analyzes and improves execution plans.
- **Memory efficiency**: Using a columnar memory format rather than row-based storage, Polars efficiently handles larger-than-memory datasets and performs operations with minimal memory overhead.
- **Lazy evaluation**: Polars supports both eager and lazy execution modes. The lazy API builds optimized query plans before execution, similar to database query planners, resulting in more efficient data processing pipelines.
